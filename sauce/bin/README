This folder contains a collection of scipts/tools for various
maintenance tasks that had to be done previously.
They were all written with a specific problem at hand that might
not even be relevant anymore.
Most importantly, they have not been updated with the rest of the
code base so if you consider using any of them, carefully check
their history, comments and test them on a test database first.

You have been warned.
