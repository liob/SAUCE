-------------

- Use the Twitter Bootstrap CSS framework which implies some major
  usage paradigm changes, of course

  controller with lazy evaluation of test results
- Unified submission result state descriptors: Success, Failed or None
  (depending on the recently run testruns)

- Tons and tons of beautifications, bug fixes etc.
